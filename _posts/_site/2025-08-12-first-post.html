<p>Welcome to my website and blog!</p>

<p>I plan on using this website to document some (hopefully) interesting side projects I’ll work on alongside my PhD (and beyond), that one day might help me achieve gainful employment. I’ll also be shamelessly promoting whatever (if any) research I end up producing, as well as any generic thoughts/waffle I decide to write down, probably around ML, finance, football, cycling, hockey etc.</p>

<p>Maybe one day I’ll look back at how creative and keen I was as a first year PhD, but I imagine more likely will see how horrible my coding practise was and how it doesn’t matter anymore as LLMs do everything now anyway.</p>

<p>If anything I have written about seems interesting, feel free:</p>
