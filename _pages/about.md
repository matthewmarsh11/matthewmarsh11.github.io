I'm a PhD student within both the [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering Group (OptiML PSE)](https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/) and Optimisation Methods for Green Applications (OMEGA) groups within the Sargent Centre at **Imperial College London**.

I research **Probabilistic Machine Learning for Decision Making under Uncertainty**, where I develop new algorithms and methods for modelling and controlling Process Systems. This involves interesting inductive biases into Machine Learning models to ensure feasibility with known underlying phenomena.

I generally like the application of mathematical and ML modelling and methods to real world problems such as sports, finance, and more. I write about some of the side projects I do [here](/blog/), and also food I have eaten and if I think it's any good.
