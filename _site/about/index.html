<p>I’m a PhD student within both the <a href="https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/">Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering Group (OptiML PSE)</a> and Optimisation Methods for Green Applications (OMEGA) groups within the Sargent Centre at <strong>Imperial College London</strong>.</p>

<p>I research <strong>Probabilistic Machine Learning for Decision Making under Uncertainty</strong>, where I develop new algorithms and methods for modelling and controlling Process Systems. This involves interesting inductive biases into Machine Learning models to ensure feasibility with known underlying phenomena.</p>

<p>I generally like the application of mathematical and ML modelling and methods to real world problems such as sports, finance, and more. I write about some of the side projects I do <a href="/blog/">here</a>, and also food I have eaten and if I think it’s any good.</p>
