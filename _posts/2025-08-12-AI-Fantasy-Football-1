I like football. I watch Everton disappoint me every week and mainly hatewatch Liverpool as well. But I can never be bothered with fantasy football. I have no interest in watching Brentford v Fulham; or checking whether Ben Gannon-Doak's knee injury is worth him going on my bench or substituting for someone else. I don't care to check whether the xG overperformance of Strand-Larsen is worth his discounted price compared to Chris Wood; and I definitely can't be bothered to check this every week for 38 weeks. Excluding double game weeks, or the festive period, or if we decide to put a world cup in the middle of winter or whatever. But what I lack in attention span, I make up for with undiagnosed autism; so I decided it would be an interesting project to try and get a computer to do all this for me instead.
