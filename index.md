# Matthew Marsh

![Matthew Marsh](/assets/matthew-marsh.jpg){: style="width:200px; border-radius:50%;" }

I'm a PhD student within both the [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Systems Engineering Group (OptiML PSE)](https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/) and Optimisation Methods with Green Applications (OMEGA) groups at Imperial College London.

I research Probabilistic Machine Learning, where I develop new algorithms and methods for modelling and controlling Process Systems under uncertainty and subject to constraint satisfaction.

I like the application of mathematical and ML modelling and methods to real world problems such as sports, finance, and more. Check out my ramblings and projects below ðŸ‘‡
